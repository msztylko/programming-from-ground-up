# Reading and Writing Simple Records

Persistent data:
1. Structured - has internal structure, is divided up into fields and records.
2. Unstructured - text files etc.

**Database** is basically a program which handles persistent structured data. You donâ€™t
have to write the programs to read and write the data to disk, to do lookups, or even to do
basic processing.
