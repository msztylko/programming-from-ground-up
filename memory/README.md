# Intermediate Memory Topics

A computer looks at memory as a long sequence of numbered storage locations. A sequence of *millions* of numbered storage locations. Everything is stored in these locations. Your programs are stored there, your data is stored there, everything. Each storage location looks like every other one. **The locations holding your program are just like the ones holding your data.** In fact, the computer has no idea which are which, except that the executable file tells it where to start executing.
